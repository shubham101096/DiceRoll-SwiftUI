# DiceRoll-SwiftUI
A iOS app that rolls two dices at once and displays number on each dice. Built using SwiftUI. I built this app to learn about SwiftUI. This app involves:
1. Using spacers and padding for proper layout of elements.
2. Creating subviews with properties that can change.
3. Managing state using SwiftUI.
